# Fetches the latest claude-session scripts from
# https://github.com/Yuzhouboat/claude-session into .upstream/ (next to this
# file, git-ignored), then runs their setup: settings wizard, crontab entry,
# Claude Code workspace trust. Re-run any time to pull the latest scripts
# and review settings. `./setup.sh remove` tears it all down.
#
# Only this file, claude-schedule.conf and .gitignore belong in the
# project's repo. Don't edit this file per project — update it from the
# claude-session repo's bootstrap/ folder.
